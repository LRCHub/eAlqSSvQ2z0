Lemme show you how I can leave
When I'm in power
Then we'll see what
you'llbelieve
I got the power to
Throw you in eternity
I'll sing you louder
'Cause I'm in power
I'll sing you louder now
I'll sing you louder now
I'll sing you
I'll sing you
I'll sing you louder now
(I'll sing you louder now)
(Now, now)
I'll sing you louder
I'll sing you
I'll sing you
I'll sing you louder
(Now, now, now)
'Cause I'm in, I believe
I got you, I believe
I'll sing you, I believe
I'll got the power to
'Cause I'm in, I believe
I got you, I believe
I'll sing you louder
I'll sing you
I'll sing you louder now
I'll sing you louder now
I'll sing you
I'll sing you
I'll sing you louder now
(I'll sing you louder now)
(Now, now)
I'll sing you louder
I'll sing you
I'll sing you
I'll sing you louder
(Now, now, now)
