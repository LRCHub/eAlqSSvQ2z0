It's a mad, mad world, tell me not to be so mad about it
It's a sad, sad world, tell me that I ought to laugh about it
Funny thing is I'm the one with the cool head
Everything's fine if you pretend
Bless this mess, hallelujah
But I'm about to lose it
Don't tell me to calm down
Tell me to calm down
It's freaking me out that you're not freaking out
Don't tell me I'll be fine
Even if you're right
It's freaking me out
Don't tell me to calm down
It's a mad, mad world, trying not to lose my shit about it
In a bad, bad mood, maybe I should take a hit about it
Any other day I'd need a hug like a teddy bear
Now the room's on fire, need to get some air
Oh, bless this mess hallelujah
Thoughts and prayers, so what, who cares?
Don't tell me to calm down
Tell me to calm down
It's freaking me out that you're not freaking out
Don't tell me I'll be fine
Even if you're right
It's freaking me out
Don't tell me to calm down
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't tell me, don't tell me (to calm down)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't tell me, no, don't tell me (to calm)
Drifting through this fever dream
In microplastic submarines
Your body is not yours it seems
What the fuck is happening?
Don't tell me to calm down
Tell me to calm down
It's freaking me out that you're not freaking out
Don't tell me I'll be fine
Even if you're right
It's freaking me out
Don't tell me to calm down
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't tell me, don't tell me (to calm down)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't tell me, no, don't tell me to calm down
